# WTF Ethers: 22. Read Any Data

I've been revisiting `ethers.js` recently to refresh my understanding of the details and to write a simple tutorial called "WTF Ethers" for beginners.

All data on Ethereum is public, so `private` variables are not actually private. In this lesson, we will discuss how to read arbitrary data from a smart contract.

## Smart Contract Storage Layout

The storage in Ethereum smart contracts is a mapping of `uint256 -> uint256`. The size of `uint256` is `32 bytes`, and this fixed-sized storage space is called a `slot`. The contract's data is stored in individual slots, starting from `slot 0` by default and continuing sequentially. Each primitive data type occupies one slot, such as `uint`, `address`, and so on. However, more complex structures like arrays and mappings are more complicated, as detailed in the [documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/internals/layout_in_storage.html?highlight=Layout%20of%20State%20Variables%20in%20Storage).

Therefore, even for `private` variables without a `getter` function, you can still read their values by accessing the respective slot.

## `getStorageAt`

`ethersjs` provides the `getStorageAt()` function for developers to conveniently read the value of a specific slot:

```js
const value = await provider.getStorageAt(contractAddress, slot)
```

`getStorageAt()` takes two arguments: the contract address `contractAddress`, and the index of the variable's `slot` that you want to read.

## Reading Arbitrary Data Script

Now, let's write a script that utilizes the `getStorageAt()` function to read the owner of the Arbitrum cross-chain bridge contract. This bridge contract is an upgradable proxy contract, and the `owner` is stored in a specific slot to avoid variable collisions, without a dedicated function for reading it. We can use `getStorageAt()` to read it.

```solidity
Contract Address: 0x8315177aB297bA92A06054cE80a67Ed4DBd7ed3a
Slot Index: 0xb53127684a568b3173ae13b9f8a6016e243e63b6e8ee1178d6a717850b5d6103
```

Code:

```js
const {ethers} = require("ethers");

const INFURA_MAINNET_URL = 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/8b9750710d56460d940aeff47967c4ba';
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(INFURA_MAINNET_URL);

// Target contract address: Arbitrum ERC20 bridge (mainnet)
const addressBridge = '0x8315177aB297bA92A06054cE80a67Ed4DBd7ed3a';
// Contract owner slot
const slot = `0xb53127684a568b3173ae13b9f8a6016e243e63b6e8ee1178d6a717850b5d6103`;

const main = async () => {
    console.log("Start reading data from specific slot");
    const privateData = await provider.getStorage(addressBridge, slot);
    console.log("Read data (owner address): ", ethers.getAddress(ethers.dataSlice(privateData, 12)));
}

main()
```

Output:

## Summary

In this lesson, we have learned how to read arbitrary data from a smart contract, including private data. Due to the transparency of the Ethereum network, it is essential not to store sensitive information in smart contracts!
