# WTF Ethers: 9. Event Filtering

I've been revisiting `ethers.js` recently to refresh my understanding of the details and to write a simple tutorial called "WTF Ethers" for beginners.

Building upon the previous lesson, let's expand our knowledge by adding event filters during the listening process to filter out transfers from specific addresses.

Refer to the [ethers.js documentation](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/contract/#ContractEvent) for more details.

## Filters

When a contract emits a log (fires an event), it can contain up to 4 `indexed` items. These indexed data items are hashed and included in a [Bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter), which is a data structure that allows for efficient filtering. Therefore, an event filter can contain up to `4` topic sets, and each topic set serves as a condition to filter target events. The rules are as follows:

- If a topic set is `null`, the log topic at that position will not be filtered, and any value will match.
- If the topic set is a single value, the log topic at that position must match that value.
- If the topic set is an array, the log topic at that position must match at least one of the values in the array.

## Building Filters
The `contract` class in `ethers.js` provides the `contract.filters` method to simplify filter creation:

```js
const filter = contract.filters.EVENT_NAME( ...args ) 
```

Here, `EVENT_NAME` is the desired event name to filter and `..args` refers to the topic set/condition. Let's look at a few examples based on the previous rules.

1. Filtering `Transfer` events from the address `myAddress`:
  ```js
  contract.filters.Transfer(myAddress)
  ```

2. Filtering all `Transfer` events sent to the address `myAddress`:
  ```js
  contract.filters.Transfer(null, myAddress)
  ```

3. Filtering all `Transfer` events sent from the address `myAddress` to the address `otherAddress`:
  ```js
  contract.filters.Transfer(myAddress, otherAddress)
  ```

4. Filtering all `Transfer` events sent to the address `myAddress` or `otherAddress`:
  ```js
  contract.filters.Transfer(null, [ myAddress, otherAddress ])
  ```

## Listening for USDT Transfers from an Exchange

1. Tracking transactions where USDT is transferred out of Binance:
  
Before listening to the USDT contract, we need to understand the transaction log `Logs`, including the event `topics` and `data`. Let's find a transaction where USDT was transferred out of Binance and check its details using its hash on etherscan:

Transaction hash: [0xab1f7b575600c4517a2e479e46e3af98a95ee84dd3f46824e02ff4618523fff5](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xab1f7b575600c4517a2e479e46e3af98a95ee84dd3f46824e02ff4618523fff5)

This transaction performed one action: transferred `2983.98` USDT from `binance14` (Binance hot wallet) to the address `0x354de44bedba213d612e92d3248b899de17b0c58`.

Checking the event log `Logs` information:

![etherscan logs diagram](img/9-3.png)

- `address`: USDT contract address
- `topics[0]`: Event hash, `keccak256("Transfer(address,address,uint256)")`
- `topics[1]`: From address (Binance hot wallet)
- `topics[2]`: To address
- `data`: Transfer amount

2. Create `provider`, `abi`, and `USDT` contract variables:

  ```js
  const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(ALCHEMY_MAINNET_URL);
  // Contract address
  const addressUSDT = '0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7'
  // Exchange address
  const accountBinance = '0x28C6c06298d514Db089934071355E5743bf21d60'
  // Build ABI
  const abi = [
    "event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint value)",
    "function balanceOf(address) public view returns(uint)",
  ];
  // Build contract object
  const contractUSDT = new ethers.Contract(addressUSDT, abi, provider);
  ```

3. Retrieve the balance of USDT in the Binance hot wallet. Currently, the Binance hot wallet has over 800 million USDT.
  ```js
  const balanceUSDT = await contractUSDT.balanceOf(accountBinance)
  console.log(`USDT balance: ${ethers.formatUnits(balanceUSDT,6)}\n`)
  ```

4. Create a filter to listen for USDT transfers to Binance.

  ```js
  // 2. Create a filter to listen for USDT transfers to the exchange
  console.log("\n2. Create a filter to listen for USDT transfers to Binance")
  let filterBinanceIn = contractUSDT.filters.Transfer(null, accountBinance);
  console.log("Filter details:")
  console.log(filterBinanceIn);
  contractUSDT.on(filterBinanceIn, (res) => {
    console.log('---------Listening for USDT transfers to Binance--------');
    console.log(
      `${res.args[0]} -> ${res.args[1]} ${ethers.formatUnits(res.args[2],6)}`
    )
  })
  ```

4. Create a filter to listen for USDT transfers from Binance.

  ```js
    // 3. Create a filter to listen for USDT transfers from the exchange
    let filterToBinanceOut = contractUSDT.filters.Transfer(accountBinance);
    console.log("\n3. Create a filter to listen for USDT transfers from Binance")
    console.log("Filter details:")
    console.log(filterToBinanceOut);
    contractUSDT.on(filterToBinanceOut, (res) => {
      console.log('---------Listening for USDT transfers from Binance--------');
      console.log(
        `${res.args[0]} -> ${res.args[1]} ${ethers.formatUnits(res.args[2],6)}`
      )
    }
    );
  ```

## Summary

In this lecture, we introduced event filters and used them to monitor `USDT` transactions related to the hot wallet of Binance exchange. You can use them to monitor any transactions you are interested in, such as discover new transactions made by `smart money`, monitor which projects the `NFT` experts are investing in, and so on.
